mydocker is personal study project, according to github.com/xianlubird/mydocker.
my OS enviroment is Linux 4.4.0-141-generic x86_64, Ubuntu 16.04, go enviroment is version go1.11.2 linux/amd64.


Progress:
1.finish construct container in 01/20

2.finish construct image in 01/28

3.finish advanced function in 01/29, including "docker ps/log/exec/stop/rm/commit" and etc

4.finish network function 02/01, including create/remove network and connect/disconnect container with network



Missing function:
1. for container running in background, don't know when it go to exit status 
detect the parent process staus to judge whether container is exited, but it need a daemon therad to track all container process,
can be done in the future

2. not check image exist, container name repeat
just manual jobs



How to use mydocker?
1. down mydocker project to you $GOPATH/src/ directory
2. create configuration file in /root/image/config/conf.json, and specify some variables, the configuration content is below.

conf.json:
{
        "RootURL" : "/root/image/containers/%s/",
        "MntURL" : "/root/image/containers/%s/mnt/",
        "ImgURL" : "/root/image/imgs/",
        "IPAMPath" : "/root/image/mydocker/network/ipam/subnet.json",
        "NetworkPath" : "/root/image/mydocker/network/network/",
        "EndpointPath" : "/root/image/mydocker/network/endpoint/",
        "ContainerInfoLocation" : "/root/image/mydocker/run/%s/"
}

3. in mydocker directory, run "go build ." to compile and then run "./mydocker ..." to use it




Summary:
1. the main thinking of mydocker is create a process with 6 isolated namespaces, and use Cgroups to limit the resource usage. The 6 namespaces is "syscall.CLONE_NEWUTS | syscall.CLONE_NEWPID | syscall.CLONE_NEWNS |syscall.CLONE_NEWNET | 
syscall.CLONE_NEWIPC". 

when create the process with 6 isolated namespaces, it's called parent process, then use Cgroups to limit the parent process
resource usage. Then create docker init process as the child of parent process, docker init process call PivotRoot and Chdir to create new root file system and make current path to root directory, then mount the required directory(/proc, /dev).

ps:
when create parent process, should use below SysProcAttr, add syscall.CLONE_NEWNS to Unshareflags parameters.
cmd.SysProcAttr = &syscall.SysProcAttr{
        Cloneflags: syscall.CLONE_NEWUTS | syscall.CLONE_NEWPID | syscall.CLONE_NEWNS |
        syscall.CLONE_NEWNET | syscall.CLONE_NEWIPC,
        Unshareflags: syscall.CLONE_NEWNS,
    }



2. use AUFS implement mydocker read/write layer, read layer is already exist in OS, container only modify write layer, so 
different can use same read layer, that's why new container need less disk space.

   use mount to implement volume function.

ps:
in docker implementation, docker put the read/write layer in /var/lib/docker/aufs, there are diff,layers and mnt directories. The layers directory contains some files, one file is named as layer name and it record what other layers it depend on. The diff directory contains some directories, one directory is named as layer name and it contains what files the layer have(The ID-init named directory is read only layer, the ID named directory is read-write layerï¼Œ and read-write layer depend on read-only layer). The mnt directory is the mount directory of container layer.



3. the main work of mydocker network is create bridge and veth pairs. 

when create a bridge, set the bridge address, up bridge and set iptable rules(change the source address of traffic from 
container to bridge address), then set route rules to lead container traffic to the bridge.

when create the veth pairs(veth0 and veth1), bind veth0 to bridge, move veth1 to container network namespace, then set 
container route to use veth1 to send traffic.



4. don't know why setns syscall can't run in multiple threads enviroment
